# Killers-Data-Analyisis-Hypothesis-Testing-R

In this report weâ€™re going to study and analyse the killers dataset in order to understand the behaviour of the killers based on different factors but the main being motive of each of the killer. A killer can be called a serial killer when he/she kills more than one victim in more than one location in a very short period of time. Based on this understanding and analysis we would be able to answer different behavioural questions like killers who are motivated by enjoyment or power start at a younger age on average to the ones motivated by angel of death or not? Does the average age at first murder differ between killers with different motives? 'Angel of Death,' 'Enjoyment or power,' and 'Escape or escape arrest,' which is the key factor of our study, are the varied motives of the killers in the dataset.

Concepts used: Hypothesis Testing: Z-test, t-test.
